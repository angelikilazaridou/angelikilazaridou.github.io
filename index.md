<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p><img src="../resourses/me2.jpg" style="float:right">Iâ€™m Angeliki, a research scientist at DeepMind. </p>

<p>Before that, I was fortunate to be a graduate student of <a
href="http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/marco">Marco Baroni</a> working on grounded
language learning at the <a href="http://clic.cimec.unitn.it">CLIC Lab</a>  of
the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences of the University of Trento, Italy (<a

Before that, I did an MSc in <a
href="http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de">Computational Linguistics at the
University of Saarland</a> working with <a href="http://ivan-titov.org">Ivan
Titov</a> and <a href="http://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=46381">Caroline
Sporleder</a> on Sentiment Analysis, supported by an Erasmus Mundus Masters scholarship in Language and Communication Technology (<a href="https://lct-master.org/">EM-LCT</a>). And before that, I was a Computer Science
BSc student working with <a
href="http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~paliourg">Georgios Paliouras</a> on
Sentiment Analysis.</p>

<p>In a previous lifetime, I used to be a <a href="../resourses/kayak.jpg">kayaker</a> and a member of the Greek national team.</p>
